# ReactJS Projects

As the title suggests, I'll be posting here all the projects I create with ReactJS.

## What I want to accomplish:

- Better understanding of React.
- More hands-on(practical) experience.
- Learn/Work/Experiment with related libraries/frameworks like Redux, NextJS, etc.
- Get more familiar with the workflow of Git/Github.

### 1.  Food Order App

Using React & React Router we make a static, multi-page food ordering website.
