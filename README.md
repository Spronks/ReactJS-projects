# ReactJS Projects

As the title suggests, I'll be posting here all the projects I create with ReactJS.

## What I want to accomplish:

- Better understanding of React.
- More hands-on(practical) experience.
- Learn/Experiment with related libraries/frameworks like Redux, NextJS, etc.
- Get more familiar with the workflow of Git/Github.

## Projects:

### 1. Food Order

Using React & React Router we make a static, multi-page food ordering website.

### 2. Weather

A weather app with a search bar for selecting a city and returns useful weather data like temperature, wind plus a weather icon.
The data are fetched from the Open Weather Map API(https://openweathermap.org/).

### 3. Recipes

A recipes app with a search bar for selecting an ingredient, a drop-down menu for food preferences(vegan, low-sugar etc.) and it returns us a number of recipes tiled in two columns with an image and a title. The images are clickable, open a new window and transfer us to the relative recipe's page.

### 4. Tesla clone

A Tesla site clone using React, React-Reveal, Redux, MaterialUI and Styled-Components.

### 5. Huddle

Huddle landing page with curved sections, a challenge from FrontendMentor:

For styling we used Styled Components.
